# flow_model

Code for the ice dynamics and PDD models used for all model runs in [[1]](#1). The ice dynamics model is based on the stress balance model presented in [[2]](#2) It is implemented in Python3 using the  [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/)  package for the parallel solution of partial differential equations.
